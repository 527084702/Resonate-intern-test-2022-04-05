    <h2>Question 1: Level 200</h2>
    <p>
      Our national retail client has a 200-store branch network, they want to do a big promotion give-away.</br>
      To participate, customers must enter their email address with a unique code (which is printed on their dockets) into OUR website.</br>
      No store has more than 10,000 customers/day.</br></br>
      The code must be no more than 9 characters long, and we have to be able to get the following information out:</br></br>
        - Which store does the code belong to?</br>
        - Which date was the code issued?</br>
        - Which customer (transaction) did the docket belong to (a number starting again at 1 every day)</br></br>
      Consider how easy it is for the end users to read/copy the code into the website and how we can prevent cheaters.</br></br>
      Write the methods for generating+decoding this unique code that will be printed on the docket by forking the following Pen:</br>
